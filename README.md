# Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning


Welcome to my Laptop Price Prediction project! My name is Fuad Kemal, and I am a third-year Computer Science student. This project is a part of my academic journey, focusing on applying machine learning techniques to predict the prices of laptops based on various features.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop given its specifications. By analyzing a dataset of laptop characteristics and their corresponding prices, the model aims to provide insights and predictions that can assist consumers in making informed purchasing decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project includes various features of laptops such as:

- **Brand**: The manufacturer of the laptop.
- **Model**: The specific model of the laptop.
- **Processor**: Details about the CPU, such as brand and model.
- **RAM**: The amount of memory in GB.
- **Storage**: Type and capacity of storage (e.g., SSD, HDD).
- **Graphics**: Information about the GPU.
- **Display**: Size and resolution of the laptop screen.
- **Price**: The price of the laptop in a specific currency.

## Methodology

 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between different features and their impact on laptop prices.
Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for price prediction, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
 Model Training: Training the selected models on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Results and Conclusion

The final model selected for this project demonstrates a significant ability to predict laptop prices with reasonable accuracy. The insights gained from this project can be useful for both consumers and retailers in understanding the pricing dynamics of laptops.
